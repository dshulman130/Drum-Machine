# Drum-Machine
A simple drum machine created with Vue.js. This was my first time using Vue, I love it so far!

## Welcome to the Vue Drum Machine!
- To get started, click the **Code** button in the top right and click **Download ZIP**
- Extract these files anywhere you like and let's begin!

### Installation and Setup
#### How to Open the Command Prompt
- Open a command prompt
  - On Windows this can be accomplished by pressing the **F4** button while in the project folder and typing **cmd** and pressing **Enter**
  - On MacOS this can be accomplished by pressing **Control + Option + Shift + T** altogether
#### NPM and Node.js (package manager and backend)
- We first need to install NPM to help us install the rest of the depenencies of this project
- Follow the instructions [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install NPM, which comes conveniently bundled with Node.js
#### Vue.js (the frontend)
- After NPM is installed, [open the command prompt](#how-to-open-the-comand-prompt)
- Type `npm install vue`
- That's it!

### Running the app
#### Starting the local server
- Follow the above instructions to open a command prompt inside the `drum-app` folder
- Type the following command to start the server: `npm run serve`
- After a few seconds, the server should now be running

#### Opening the Drum Machine
- Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/
  - Alternatively if you'd like to open this on another device, the command prompt where your server is running should provide a different address to access this page over the network. Such as http://192.168.1.1:8080/
- This should open the Drum Machine's web page in the browser on your machine

### Using the Drum Machine
- Slide the volume slider to adjust the volume
- Click on the buttons to play the sound associated with that button
  - The names for the sound being played are displayed at the top left
- The power switch will stop all audio when set to **off**
- Enjoy!
